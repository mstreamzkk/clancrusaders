                        <h3>Dragons</h3>
                        <p> Dragons in DTK are fat. They are fat and cute like potatoes. It is likely that the original dragons were not fat. However, untold years of sleeping has made our dragons plump and swollen. Because of this, they rely on mechanical augmentation. They have propellers to fly, for instance. They cannot breathe fire, but have developed a device, wearable on their immense bodies, which allows them to shoot jets of flame. They love gold and their favorite food is Knights (when attacking castles) and Thieves (when finding thieves in their lairs). Dragons are few in number but have great strength. </p>

                        <h3>Thieves</h3>
                        <p> In Erf, the King of Thieves still rules. He is old, very old, but the silver bells fixed to his ankles still shine like the moon (Jimmy put this cursed anklet on the King). Thieves live in a society where thievery is legal, and the norm. Most thieves have a professional trade like blacksmithing or carpentry and practices thievery to get whatever else they want. </p>
                        <p> Most thieves steal from knights and some thieves are brave enough to face the dragons. </p>
                        <p> Thieves are extremely short and very lithe. Thieves have developed the ability to turn their skin into the color of their surroundings. This active camouflage is the secret to their success. They shy away from pitched combat and prefer to fight their enemies using subterfuge and whoopie cushions. </p>
                        <p> The thieves' motivation is to steal the hoards of the dragons' and the knights' holy relics and then return to their home. They want to seal Erf off again, and the King of Thieves is determined to get the bells off his feet, or die trying! </p>

                        <h3>Knights</h3>
                        <p> Knights: Honor. Armor. And Huge Freaking Guns. </p>
                        <p> The Knights of Erf have had an amazing set of technological breakthroughs. They have retired their long swords and now wield assault rifles. They still favor the horse for its versatility on terrain and ride when they can, for their armor is heavy. </p>
                        <p> Picture Al from FullMetal Alchemist on a galloping horse shooting an AK-47. </p>
                        <p> Knights build big castles. Most of their hobbies are what you'd expect: rescuing princesses, torturing thieves in the dungeon, dueling, and shooting dragons. Unfortunately, there are no princesses, so they take turns dressing up like one and getting captured by other knights. </p>
                        <p> The Knights' greatest weakness is an attack to his honor. There are many mournful accounts of a knight sitting down to sup in his hall with the Princess (cross-dresser) he has saved, only to be embarrassed by a huge burst of flatulence from the whoopie cushion snuck under his seat by the thief. </p>
